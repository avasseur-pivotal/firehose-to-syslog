# Yml formatted file

# "rfc5424" defines a set of Org/Space/AppName regexp to capture
# - if "meta" is present, it will be added as RFC5424 structured data
# - if a rule has "intercept" present (and if there is an "intercept"
#   configuration) then the LogMessage who are prefixed with it will be
#   captured and written to the configured intercept filename
# - the optional "skip-syslog" can be used to only have intercept to log
#   and no syslog out.
#
# "intercept" defines the configuration of log files for the intercepted
# LogMessage. The "filename" %s is substituted with the Org id
