# This is a fork

This is a fork from https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/firehose-to-syslog

Added & changed:
- not using Logrus syslog but using a custom implementation derived from https://github.com/papertrail/remote_syslog2/tree/master/syslog
- this is to implement optional RFC5424 structured data field in addition to the message field
- adding --filter-path=...file.txt that contains a yml configuration file for the regexp matching against orgName/spaceName/appName and the structureddata to add
- optional skipping syslog 
- optional intercept LogMessage to a rolling logfile, one file per org, intercepting prefix (and removing it before logging)

If --filter-path is used then:
unless there is a wildcard .* :
- logs that do not have appName (found from app id and cache) are discarded
- orgName/spaceName/appName is matched to the regexp in order till a match - else discarded
- if matched, and if regexp is associated with a structureddata, the structureddata is added to the syslog message in RFC5424 format
If there is a wildcard .* then all logs including those without app id are accepted and enriched with the provided ".* TAB structureddata" from the filter file


# Example command
You can test using PCFdev and using `cf push -o cloudfoundry/lattice-app lattice`

```
./firehose-to-syslog \
--api-endpoint https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation --user=admin --password=admin \
--syslog-server=localhost:5001 \
-subscription-id="exlog" \
--events=LogMessage --filter-path=rfc5424/rfc5424.yml \
--debug
```



# Example yml
See rfc5424/ folder
```
# Yml formatted file
#
# "rfc5424" defines a set of Org/Space/AppName regexp to capture
# - if "meta" is present, it will be added as RFC5424 structured data
# - if a rule has "intercept" present (and if there is an "intercept"
#   configuration) then the LogMessage who are prefixed with it will be
#   captured and written to the configured intercept filename
# - the optional "skip-syslog" can be used to only have intercept to log
#   and no syslog out.
#
# "intercept" defines the configuration of log files for the intercepted
# LogMessage. The "filename" %s is substituted with the Org id
#
---
rfc5424:
  - rule: demo1
    space: "^France-org/development/.*"
  - rule: demo2

    meta: '[xx@123 code="lattice"]'
    intercept: "Lattice-"
  - rule: catchAll
    space: .*
#    meta: '[meta sequenceid=""][xx@123 code="1CF"]'
    skip-syslog: false

#Endpoint definition

We use [gocf-client](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/go-cfclient) which will call the CF endpoint /v2/info to get Auth., doppler endpoint.

But for doppler endpoint you can overwrite it with ``` --doppler-address ``` as we know some people use different endpoint.

# Event documentation

See the [dropsonde protocol documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dropsonde-protocol/tree/master/events) for details on what data is sent as part of each event.

# Caching
We use [boltdb](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) for caching application name, org and space name.

We have 3 caching strategies:
* Pull all application data on start.
* Pull application data if not cached yet.
* Pull all application data every "cc-pull-time".

# To test and build


    # Setup repo
    go get github.com/cloudfoundry-community/firehose-to-syslog
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudfoundry-community/firehose-to-syslog

    # Test
	ginkgo -r .

    # Build binary
    godep go build

# Deploy with Bosh

[logsearch-for-cloudfoundry](https://github.com/logsearch/logsearch-for-cloudfoundry)

# Run against a bosh-lite CF deployment

    godep go run main.go \
		--debug \
		--skip-ssl-validation \

# Docker (tested with docker 1.7.1 / Kitematic)
We use DockerInDocker to built the image
Since is around 7MG

* For Github Master branch Image
```bash
# Make the image
make docker-final

#Run the image
docker run getourneau/firehose-to-syslog

```

* For development
```bash
#Build the image
make docker-dev

#Run the image
docker run getourneau/firehose-to-syslog-dev
```


# Devel

This is a
[Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
project. Please fork and branch your features from develop.

# Profiling

To enable CPU Profiling you just need to add the profiling path ex ``` --mode-prof=cpu```

Run your program for some time and after that you can use the pprof tool
```bash
go tool pprof YOUR_EXECUTABLE cpu.pprof

1. Turn off the health check if you're staging to Diego.

		cf set-health-check firehose-to-syslog none

1. Push the app.

		cf push firehose-to-syslog --no-route

	If you are using the offline version of the go buildpack and your app fails to stage then open up the Godeps/Godeps.json file and change the `GoVersion` from `go1.5.3` to `go1.5` and repush.
